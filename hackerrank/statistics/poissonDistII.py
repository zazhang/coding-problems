"""Poisson Distribution II (statistics)

The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine of either type A or type B. For each dayâ€™s operation:

The number of repairs, X, that machine A needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 0.88. The daily cost of operating A is C_A = 160+40*X^2.
The number of repairs, Y, that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 1.55. The daily cost of operating B is C_B = 128+40*Y^2.
