"""Geometric Distribution II (statistics)

The probability that a machine produces a defective product is 1/3. What is the probability that the 1st defect is found during the first 5 inspection?

Notes: meaning 1st defect at 1st inspection + 1st defect at 2nd insepction + ...
+ 1st defect at 5th inspection
