"""Normal Distribution II (statistics)

The final grades for a Physics exam taken by a large group of students have a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10. If we can approximate the distribution of these grades by a normal distribution, what percentage of the students:

Scored higher than 80 (i.e., have a X > 80)?
Passed the test (i.e., have a X >= 60)?
Failed the test (i.e., have a X < 60)?
