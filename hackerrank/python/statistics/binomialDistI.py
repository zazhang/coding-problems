"""Binomial Distribution I (statistics)

The ratio of boys to girls for babies born in Russia is 1.09:1. 
If there is 1 child born per birth, what proportion of Russian families 
with exactly 6 children will have at least 3 boys?

Write a program to compute the answer using the above parameters. 
Then print your result, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places
