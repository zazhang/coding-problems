### @author: Albert

This repo contains my solutions for coding problems found at different websites.

Practice makes perfect!

## Leetcode
A well-known place to check/improve coding ability.

## InterviewBit
The programming section has eight levels covering all important topics in computer science.

The folder contains the practice problems and examples.

This is the site to learn basic data structures and algorithms.

## HackerRank
A good interview preparation website. Many companies host their online assessment at this site.

I implement the coding problems in python, java, and c++ to get familiar with these programming languages.
