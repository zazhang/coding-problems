"""Coding interview problem (graphs): 

There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. 
Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend 
of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. 
And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or 
indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students 
in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends 
with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of 
friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
